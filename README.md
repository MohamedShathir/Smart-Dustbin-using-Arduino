# Smart-Dustbin-using-Arduino


## Project Description

Hey Friends,

Welcome to the Smart Dustbin project! In this project, I'll guide you through the process of creating your very own Smart Dustbin for your home. 

The Smart Dustbin, as the name suggests, operates intelligently, functioning as an automatic dustbin. It operates by automatically opening its lid when it detects someone approaching, thanks to the integration of a servo motor and sensors.

This project is a fantastic application of Arduino technology, offering a convenient and innovative solution to keeping your home clean and tidy. With the Smart Dustbin in place, you can effectively manage waste disposal without hassle.

Children particularly enjoy interacting with this Smart Dustbin. Its automatic opening mechanism and interactive nature make cleaning up a fun and engaging task for them. As they use the Smart Dustbin, they contribute to keeping the surroundings clean, making it a win-win situation for all.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motor

## How It Works

The Smart Dustbin operates based on the principle of proximity detection. When someone approaches the dustbin, the ultrasonic sensor detects their presence, triggering the servo motor to open the lid automatically. Once the person moves away from the dustbin, the lid closes automatically, ensuring efficient waste containment.

## Support

If you encounter any difficulties during the project implementation, feel free to reach out for assistance. We're here to help you overcome any challenges and ensure that you successfully complete your Smart Dustbin.

Happy building! üõ†Ô∏èüóëÔ∏è
